# RPS-Multiplayer
Rock Paper Scissors multiplayer made in NodeJS with Socket.io

This is something i made in a weekend when i was bored. The code works, and is pretty Ok. but it can definetly be done better.

Nevertheless it works pretty well, and all the rings and bells are included, the css is there and i went for a dark-theme.
